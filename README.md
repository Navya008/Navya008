# 💫 About Me:
Hi there! I'm **Navya Pradeep**, an enthusiastic B.Tech student specializing in **Electronics and Communication Engineering** with a **minor in Computer Science Engineering**. I’m passionate about technology, problem-solving, and working on impactful projects.I’ve found that I learn best by building, breaking, and fixing things — working on embedded projects helps me understand what works, what doesn’t, and why.
I enjoy building real-world solutions, experimenting with microcontrollers, and learning by doing.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects related to **Embedded Systems** and **sensor-based control applications**
- 🌱 Exploring **VLSI Design**, **Verilog HDL**, and **FPGA implementation**
- 🤝 I’m open to internships and collaborative projects in **Embedded Systems** , **Digital Design** and **fpga**
